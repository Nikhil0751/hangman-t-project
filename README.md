The project aims to deliver a polished and bug-free game within the specified timeline and it approaches towards the interest of the users .

Development Approach:

Planning Phase: Define project scope, establish roles and responsibilities, and create a timeline.
Design Phase: Design the game mechanics, user interface, and draft a storyboard.
Development Phase: Implement the game logic, UI elements, and integrate necessary features.
Testing Phase: Conduct rigorous testing to identify and fix bugs, usability issues, and ensure smooth gameplay.
Deployment Phase: Prepare the game for release, finalize documentation, and launch the Hangman game.
Communication and Collaboration : The team will utilize communication tools such as Google Meet for daily updates, Github for task management, and hold regular meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and brainstorm ideas. " Collaboration will be key to ensuring the successful completion of the project. "

Project Goals :

Develop a high-quality Hangman game with an intuitive game play.
Ensure the game is bug-free and provides an enjoyable gaming experience.
Meet project deadlines and deliverables according to the agreed-upon timeline.
Receive positive feedback from users and stakeholders upon game release.
Success Criteria :

Game functionality meets the requirements outlined in the project scope.
Minimal bugs and issues identified during testing phase.
Positive user feedback and engagement with the game.
Project completed within the specified timeline and budget constraints.

Team Motto : "Crafting code, one hangman at a time! Together, we code, design, and test for success."

Test Cases:
Case-1 "@","#" etc.
If you enter any symbols then  it will say to enter its correct form in the form of alphabet.

Case-2 "1","2" etc.
If you enter any numbers then it will say to enter its correct in the form of alphabet.

Case-3 "i" or "I" etc.
If you enter capital or small letters it will assume both of them as same characters .

In the first version we have made the simple hangman game code using python and in the upcoming version we will work on various other functionalities and we have to work on variables and identifiers that are nor declared properly and this game need to improve its version for more clarity of the users.


Now we have tested the UI/UX of the game and now in the third version we are going to update the game with a set of rules and instructions.

And now comes the third version where we have implemented the set of rules and instructions and in the next version we are going for a multiplayer level version .

We have made four versions in this game and each inckudes it's one step ahead of it and all the problems are solved related ti it .
